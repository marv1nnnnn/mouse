# Glyph Protocol: Execution Plan & Granular Log
## Parent Task ID: GLYPH#TASK_20240721100000_A1B2C3
## Parent Task Title: Build a Minimum Movie Recommendation System

**Parent Task File Link:** `../../tasks/GLYPH#TASK_20240721100000_A1B2C3.md`
**Plan Generation Date:** `2024-07-21T10:01:00Z`
**Plan Version:** `1.0`
**Last Updated By:** `Agent`
**Last Updated At:** `2024-07-21T10:01:00Z`

**Overall Task Objective (Summarized from parent task `Description` and `Deliverables`):**
> Develop a basic content-based movie recommendation system using Python and mock data, focusing on movie genres, and provide a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

**Key Assumptions for this Plan:**
> - User ratings can be simple (e.g., a list of movies liked by the user).
> - "Minimum" implies a straightforward genre-matching algorithm without complex machine learning models.
> - Standard Python libraries are sufficient; no external, complex dependencies are required immediately.

## Sub-Task Execution Sequence & Logs:

**SubTaskID:** `GLYPH#TASK_20240721100000_A1B2C3/Sub-1`
**Objective:** Define Python data structures for movies and user preferences, and create mock data for testing.
**Estimated Sub-Task Effort:** `S`
**InitialKeySteps (Agent's Envisioned Actions):**
  - Create `src/` directory if it doesn't exist.
  - Define a list of dictionaries for movies (e.g., `[{'id': 1, 'title': 'Movie A', 'genres': ['Action', 'Sci-Fi']}, ...]`).
  - Define a dictionary for user preferences (e.g., `{'user1': [1, 3], 'user2': [2]}`, where values are liked movie IDs).
  - Populate `src/mock_data.py` with this data.
**Status:** `Done`
**Deliverables (Sub-Task Specific):**
  - "`src/mock_data.py` file created with defined movie and user preference data."
**ContextualInputs (CRITICAL - Populated by Agent *at start of sub-task execution*):**
  - N/A (First sub-task)
**ProactiveAnalysis (Completed by Agent during initial `PlanFile` generation for this sub-task):**
  - **IdentifiedRisks & Likelihood/Impact (L/M/H):**
    - `Risk 1: Data format might be insufficient for later, more complex logic (Likelihood: L, Impact: M) - Mitigation: Keep structures simple but extensible (e.g., using dictionaries).`
  - **MitigationStrategies (Planned):**
    - `Ensure movie IDs are unique.`
    - `Ensure user preference data correctly references movie IDs.`
  - **UnstatedDependencies (Discovered during sub-task planning):**
    - N/A
  - **KeyAssumptionsForThisSubTask:**
    - `A small, representative dataset is sufficient for a 'minimum' system.`
**SuggestedTestCases (If applicable, as per `@glyph/standards/testing_strategy.glyph.mdc`):**
  - `Verify `movies` list in `mock_data.py` is not empty and contains dictionaries with 'id', 'title', and 'genres' keys.`
  - `Verify `user_ratings` dictionary in `mock_data.py` contains user IDs as keys and lists of movie IDs as values.`

**SubTaskID:** `GLYPH#TASK_20240721100000_A1B2C3/Sub-2`
**Objective:** Implement the core content-based recommendation logic based on movie genres.
**Estimated Sub-Task Effort:** `M`
**InitialKeySteps (Agent's Envisioned Actions):**
  - Create `src/recommender.py`.
  - Implement `get_user_liked_genres(user_id, movies_data, user_ratings_data)` function.
  - Implement `recommend_movies(user_id, movies_data, user_ratings_data, num_recommendations=5)` function:
    - Get user's liked movies and their genres.
    - Find other movies with matching genres.
    - Filter out movies already liked/rated by the user.
    - (Optional) Sort recommendations by relevance (e.g., number of matching genres).
    - Return top N recommendations.
**Status:** `Done`

**ProactiveAnalysis (Completed by Agent during initial `PlanFile` generation for this sub-task):**
  - **IdentifiedRisks & Likelihood/Impact (L/M/H):**
    - `Risk 1: Recommendation quality might be poor with very simple genre matching (Likelihood: M, Impact: M) - Mitigation: This is a 'minimum' system; acknowledge limitations.`
    - `Risk 2: Handling users with no ratings or diverse tastes (Likelihood: M, Impact: M) - Mitigation: Implement a fallback (e.g., popular movies, though this is out of scope for minimal version). For now, return empty list or simple message.`
  - **MitigationStrategies (Planned):**
    - `Focus on clear genre extraction and matching.`
    - `Ensure efficient lookup of movies and user data.`
  - **UnstatedDependencies (Discovered during sub-task planning):**
    - N/A
  - **KeyAssumptionsForThisSubTask:**
    - `Simple count of matching genres is a sufficient ranking mechanism for a 'minimum' system.`
**SuggestedTestCases (If applicable, as per `@glyph/standards/testing_strategy.glyph.mdc`):**
  - `Test with a user who likes 'Action' movies; recommendations should include other 'Action' movies not yet seen.`
  - `Test with a user who has seen all movies of their preferred genre; recommendations should be empty or handle this case gracefully.`
  - `Test with a new user (no ratings); should return empty list or default popular items (if implemented).`
