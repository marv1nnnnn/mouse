  **Specific Inputs:**
  - User feedback on dashboard functionality issues
  - Browser console error messages and warnings
  - Existing `glyph_dashboard.html` with functional issues
  - 6 tasks and 1 plan detected in user's project

  **Detailed Requirements/Steps:**
  1. **Fix Tab Switching Logic:**
     - Resolve issue where tab content panels don't display when switching tabs
     - Improve tab activation and panel showing mechanism
     - Add graph re-rendering when switching tabs to ensure proper sizing
     - Handle tab name matching more reliably

  2. **Fix Browser Console Warnings:**
     - Address non-passive event listener warnings for wheel events
     - Add proper event listener options to prevent performance warnings
     - Maintain zoom functionality while fixing browser complaints

  3. **Fix Timeline Graph Errors:**
     - Resolve negative circle radius error in timeline visualization
     - Add bounds checking to prevent invalid SVG attribute values
     - Ensure minimum radius values for timeline task circles
     - Fix vertical line positioning calculations

  4. **Add Overview Tab Interactivity:**
     - Make task cards in overview tab clickable
     - Open task detail modals when cards are clicked
     - Add visual feedback for clickable cards
     - Include click hint text on cards

  5. **Enhance User Experience:**
     - Improve hover effects for better visual feedback
     - Add cursor pointer styling for clickable elements
     - Enhance task card styling for better interactivity indication

  **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
  - All dashboard tabs switch properly and display content
  - No browser console warnings or errors
  - Timeline graph renders without negative radius errors
  - Overview task cards open detail modals when clicked
  - Smooth user interaction with proper visual feedback
  - All existing functionality preserved

  **Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Maintain standalone HTML file approach
  - Preserve all existing visualization functionality
  - Ensure backward compatibility with current data structures
  - Fix issues without breaking auto-loading or upload features

## Bug Fixes and Improvements Summary

This task successfully resolved all critical dashboard functionality issues reported by the user:

### üîß Tab Switching Fix
- **Issue:** Clicking tab buttons showed no content in panels
- **Root Cause:** Event target reference and panel ID matching issues
- **Solution:** Improved tab switching logic with proper panel identification and activation
- **Enhancement:** Added graph re-rendering on tab switch to ensure proper sizing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Browser Console Warnings Fix
- **Issue:** Non-passive event listener warnings for wheel events affecting performance
- **Root Cause:** Missing event listener options for scroll-blocking events
- **Solution:** Added `{ passive: false }` option to wheel event listeners
- **Result:** Eliminated browser performance warnings while maintaining zoom functionality

### üî¥ Timeline Graph Error Fix
- **Issue:** Error "attribute r: A negative value is not valid" for circle elements
- **Root Cause:** Calculation of `taskHeight / 3` resulting in negative values with few tasks
- **Solution:** Added `Math.max(5, ...)` bounds checking to ensure minimum radius of 5
- **Enhancement:** Fixed corresponding vertical line positioning to use calculated radius

### üñ±Ô∏è Overview Tab Interactivity
- **Issue:** Task cards in overview tab not clickable for details
- **Previous State:** Cards had hover effects but no click functionality
