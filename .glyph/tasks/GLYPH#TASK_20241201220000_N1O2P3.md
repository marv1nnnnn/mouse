Title: Fix Graph Zoom, Remove Dependencies Tab, and Enhance Task Modals
Description: |
  **Background/Context:** User reported three critical issues: clunky zoom affecting whole page instead of graph content, unnecessary dependencies tab since there are no task dependencies, and non-functional task detail modals.

  **Specific Issues Identified:**
  - Zoom functionality affecting entire page instead of graph content
  - Dependencies tab showing despite no task dependencies existing
  - Task detail modals not opening when clicking "Click for details"

  **Specific Inputs:**
  - User feedback on zoom behavior and UI structure
  - Existing dashboard with whole-page zoom implementation
  - Non-functional modal system for task details
  - Project with 6 tasks and 1 plan, no inter-task dependencies

  **Detailed Requirements/Steps:**
  1. **Fix Graph Zoom Implementation:**
     - Replace page-level zoom with SVG-specific zoom and pan
     - Create transform groups within SVG elements for proper zoom behavior
     - Implement mouse wheel zoom that only affects graph content
     - Add proper pan functionality with drag gestures
     - Ensure zoom is isolated to individual graph views

  2. **Remove Dependencies Tab:**
     - Remove dependencies tab button from navigation
     - Remove dependencies panel from DOM
     - Remove renderDependenciesGraph function
     - Update all tab switching and control logic
     - Move graph controls to remaining tabs (Timeline, Status Flow)

  3. **Fix and Enhance Task Detail Modals:**
     - Debug and fix modal opening functionality
     - Enhance modal content with comprehensive task information
     - Add proper markdown-style formatting for descriptions
     - Improve visual layout with structured sections
     - Add debugging console logs for troubleshooting

  4. **UI/UX Improvements:**
     - Enhance modal styling with better visual hierarchy
     - Add icons and color coding for different sections
     - Implement collapsible sections for history logs
     - Improve readability with proper spacing and typography

  **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
  - Graph zoom only affects SVG content, not entire page
  - Dependencies tab completely removed from interface
  - Task cards open detailed modals when clicked
  - Modal displays comprehensive task information with proper formatting
  - All existing functionality preserved for remaining features

  **Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Maintain standalone HTML file approach
  - Preserve existing auto-loading and upload functionality
  - Ensure smooth user interaction with proper feedback
  - Keep timeline and status flow visualizations intact

## Implementation Summary

This task successfully addressed all three critical user experience issues:

### üîç Fixed Graph Zoom Implementation
- **Issue:** Zoom affecting entire page instead of graph content
- **Root Cause:** Pan/zoom applied to SVG element transform instead of content groups
- **Solution:** 
  - Created SVG transform groups for all graph content
  - Implemented proper coordinate-based zoom with mouse cursor targeting
  - Added pan functionality using document-level mouse events
  - Used SVG transform attributes instead of CSS transforms
- **Result:** Smooth, isolated zoom/pan for graph content only

### üóÇÔ∏è Removed Dependencies Tab
- **Issue:** Unnecessary tab showing despite no task dependencies
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Removed dependencies tab button from navigation
  - Removed dependencies panel from DOM structure
  - Deleted `renderDependenciesGraph()` function entirely
  - Updated all tab switching and control logic
  - Moved graph controls to Timeline and Status Flow tabs
  - Updated window resize handlers and fit-to-view functionality
- **Result:** Cleaner interface focused on relevant visualizations

### üìã Enhanced Task Detail Modals
- **Issue:** Non-functional modal system with poor content formatting
- **Improvements Made:**
  - Fixed modal opening functionality with debugging logs
  - Enhanced content structure with visual hierarchy
  - Added markdown-style formatting for descriptions
  - Implemented structured sections with icons and color coding
  - Added collapsible history log with formatted entries
  - Improved grid layout for task metadata
  - Enhanced status and priority visual indicators
