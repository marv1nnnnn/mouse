TaskID: GLYPH#TASK_20241201230000_Q3R4S5
Title: Add Comprehensive Plan and Subtask Visualization to Dashboard
Description: |
  **Background/Context:** User feedback indicated the dashboard was too task-focused and needed better visualization of plans and subtasks, which are equally important in the Glyph Protocol workflow.

  **Specific Inputs:**
  - User request: "Looks now the visualization is mostly around tasks, not plans. Should also visualize plans as well"
  - Current dashboard with task-centric views only
  - Rich plan data including subtasks, execution logs, and progress information
  - Need for balanced visualization of both tasks and execution plans

  **Detailed Requirements/Steps:**
  1. **Add Dedicated Plans Tab:**
     - Create new Plans tab with plan-specific grid layout
     - Show plan cards with subtask progress visualization
     - Include progress bars and completion percentages
     - Display plan metadata and generation dates

  2. **Enhanced Statistics Dashboard:**
     - Add total plans count
     - Add completed subtasks tracking
     - Update statistics calculation to include plan metrics
     - Provide comprehensive project overview

  3. **Plan Cards with Rich Information:**
     - Show parent task relationship
     - Display subtask progress with visual indicators
     - Include completed, in-progress, and blocked subtask counts
     - Add plan generation date and status

  4. **Enhanced Timeline with Subtask Support:**
     - Add optional "Show Subtasks" toggle
     - Display subtasks alongside tasks in chronological order
     - Use visual differentiation (size, style, opacity)
     - Maintain parent-child relationship clarity

  5. **Improved Navigation and Tab Management:**
     - Update tab switching logic for new Plans tab
     - Ensure proper rendering on tab switches
     - Update all control functions to handle plans

  6. **Visual Design Enhancements:**
     - Progress bars with color-coded completion status
     - Status icons for different subtask states (‚úÖ ‚è≥ üö´)
     - Hierarchical visual organization
     - Consistent color schemes across all visualizations

  **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
  - New Plans tab displaying all execution plans with progress tracking
  - Enhanced statistics showing plan and subtask metrics
  - Timeline view with optional subtask display
  - Clear visual hierarchy between tasks, plans, and subtasks
  - Consistent navigation and interaction across all tabs
  - Improved project comprehension through balanced task/plan visualization

  **Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Maintain existing task visualization functionality
  - Ensure performance with large numbers of subtasks
  - Keep consistent visual design language
  - Preserve all existing features while adding new capabilities
  - Maintain responsive design across device sizes

## Implementation Summary

This task successfully transformed the dashboard from task-centric to a balanced task and plan visualization platform:

### üìä **New Plans Tab**
- **Dedicated Plan Visualization**: Complete tab focused on execution plans
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars showing subtask completion percentages
- **Status Distribution**: Clear indicators for completed (‚úÖ), in-progress (‚è≥), and blocked (üö´) subtasks
- **Plan Metadata**: Generation dates, parent task relationships, and plan status
- **Interactive Cards**: Click-to-view parent task details from plan cards

### üìà **Enhanced Statistics Dashboard**
- **Total Plans**: Count of all execution plans in the project
- **Subtask Tracking**: Total and completed subtask counts
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Balanced view of tasks, plans, and subtasks
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear indication of project execution progress

### üéØ **Plan Card Features**
- **Progress Visualization**: Color-coded progress bars (green=complete, blue=in-progress, gray=pending)
- **Subtask Breakdown**: Visual count of subtasks by status with emoji indicators
- **Parent Task Integration**: Links to parent task for full context
- **Plan Status**: Derived status based on subtask completion (done/in-progress/blocked/pending)
- **Generation Tracking**: Display of plan creation dates

### üìÖ **Enhanced Timeline View**
- **Subtask Toggle**: Optional "Show Subtasks" checkbox for detailed timeline view
- **Visual Hierarchy**: 
  - Tasks: Full-sized circles with solid borders
  - Subtasks: Smaller circles with reduced opacity and italic text
- **Status Differentiation**: Subtasks show "‚Ü≥ Status" prefix for clarity
- **Chronological Accuracy**: Subtasks positioned relative to parent task timing
- **Interactive Elements**: Both tasks and subtasks link to appropriate modals

### üé® **Visual Design Improvements**
- **Color-Coded Progress**: Green for complete, blue for active, red for blocked
- **Size Hierarchy**: Tasks larger than subtasks for clear visual organization
- **Opacity Levels**: Reduced opacity for subtasks to emphasize hierarchy
- **Consistent Icons**: Status emoji indicators across all views
- **Typography**: Different font sizes and styles for tasks vs subtasks

### üîß **Technical Enhancements**
- **Tab Management**: Updated navigation to handle Plans tab properly
- **Rendering Logic**: Efficient plan grid rendering with progress calculations
- **Statistics Calculation**: Enhanced metrics including plan and subtask data
- **Timeline Algorithm**: Smart positioning of tasks and subtasks chronologically
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering for projects with many subtasks

### üìã **User Experience Benefits**
- **Balanced Perspective**: Equal focus on tasks (what) and plans (how)
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear understanding of execution progress at all levels
- **Flexible Views**: Users can choose task-only or task+subtask timeline views
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Full project visibility from high-level tasks to detailed execution
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Consistent interaction patterns across all visualization modes

The dashboard now provides a complete view of Glyph Protocol projects, showing both the strategic level (tasks) and execution level (plans/subtasks) with rich visual feedback and progress tracking capabilities.
