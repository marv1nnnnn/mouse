Title: Make Glyph Dashboard Universal for Any Project
Description: |
  Remove hardcoded file names from the Glyph Dashboard and implement a universal auto-loading system that works for any Glyph Protocol project.
  
  **Background/Context:** User pointed out that the dashboard had hardcoded file names making it project-specific rather than universal. The dashboard should work for any Glyph Protocol project without modification.
  
  **Specific Inputs:**
    - Feedback about hardcoded file names in dashboard
    - Need for universal compatibility across different Glyph projects
    - Requirement to maintain functionality while removing project-specific code
  
  **Detailed Requirements/Steps:**
    1. Remove hardcoded task and plan file names from discovery function
    2. Implement universal file discovery methods:
       - HTML directory listing parsing (works with most HTTP servers)
       - Optional index.json file support for production environments
       - Graceful fallback to upload interface when auto-discovery fails
    3. Create multiple discovery strategies to maximize compatibility
    4. Update help documentation to explain universal setup options
    5. Test with multiple discovery methods
    6. Create example index.json file to demonstrate the approach
  
  **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
    - Dashboard works with any Glyph Protocol project without modification
    - No hardcoded file names anywhere in the code
    - Multiple auto-loading strategies (directory listing, index files, upload)
    - Clear documentation for universal setup
    - Example index.json file demonstrating the approach
    - Backward compatibility with existing functionality
  
  **Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - Must not make excessive HTTP requests during discovery
    - Should be efficient and not impact performance
    - Must maintain all existing functionality
    - Should provide clear user guidance for setup
    - Must work with standard HTTP servers without special configuration

## Universal Implementation Summary:

Successfully transformed the Glyph Dashboard from project-specific to universal compatibility:

### üåç **Key Universal Features Implemented:**

1. **Dynamic Directory Listing**:
   - Parses HTML directory listings from HTTP servers
   - Automatically detects all `GLYPH#TASK_*.md` and `*_plan.md` files
   - Works with most standard HTTP servers (Python, Apache, Nginx)

2. **Simple Discovery Chain**:
   - **First**: Try directory listing (automatic, works with most HTTP servers)
   - **Second**: Fallback to upload interface (always available)

3. **Universal Setup Options**:
   - **Option 1**: Serve via HTTP (works immediately with most servers)
   - **Option 2**: Use upload feature (works offline or without server)

### ‚úÖ **Universal Compatibility Results:**

- ‚úÖ **Zero hardcoded file names** - works with any Glyph project
- ‚úÖ **Simple and reliable** - directory listing + upload fallback
- ‚úÖ **No extra files required** - works with standard Glyph folder structure
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible** - all existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ **Self-documenting** - clear setup instructions built into interface

### üöÄ **Universal Usage**:

The dashboard now works universally:
1. **Download** `glyph_dashboard.html` to any Glyph project
2. **Serve** via `python -m http.server` or similar
3. **Auto-loading** detects files automatically
4. **No configuration required** for most standard setups

This implementation makes the dashboard truly universal using the standard Glyph Protocol folder structure without requiring any additional configuration files.

**Simplified Approach**: Removed index.json complexity per user feedback, focusing on the core functionality: directory listing auto-detection with upload fallback. This keeps the solution simple, reliable, and true to the fixed Glyph Protocol structure.
