TaskID: GLYPH#TASK_20241201200000_H7I8J9
Title: Complete Dashboard Visualizations and Enhance Subtask Rendering
Description: |
  **Background/Context:** The Glyph Protocol dashboard had placeholder visualizations in the Dependencies, Timeline, and Status Flow tabs, and the subtask rendering in modals needed improvement to show comprehensive execution details.

  **Specific Inputs:**
  - Existing `glyph_dashboard.html` with placeholder visualization functions
  - Current task and plan data structures with subtask information
  - Modal implementation for task details

  **Detailed Requirements/Steps:**
  1. **Dependencies Graph Implementation:**
     - Create interactive SVG visualization showing task relationships
     - Display tasks as rectangles and subtasks as circles
     - Show dependency arrows between tasks
     - Show dashed lines connecting subtasks to parent tasks
     - Use status-based color coding
     - Enable click-to-view task details

  2. **Timeline Graph Implementation:**
     - Create chronological timeline visualization
     - Sort tasks by submission date
     - Display tasks as colored circles with timeline axis
     - Show task titles, dates, and status information
     - Include vertical dashed lines connecting to timeline

  3. **Status Flow Graph Implementation:**
     - Create kanban-style board with status columns
     - Group tasks by status (Pending, Ready, Planning, InProgress, Review, Done, Blocked, Cancelled)
     - Display tasks as cards with comprehensive information
     - Show task ID, title, priority, effort, dependencies count, and subtasks count
     - Use appropriate color schemes for each status

  4. **Enhanced Subtask Rendering:**
     - Improve modal subtask display with comprehensive information
     - Show subtask ID, status, and objective clearly
     - Display Final Output Summary with status, message, artifacts, and key outputs
     - Show error details and clarification questions when applicable
     - Implement collapsible execution logs with structured parsing
     - Format log entries with timestamps, actions, and outcomes

  5. **Interactive Features:**
     - Add pan and zoom functionality to all graphs using mouse wheel and drag
     - Implement reset zoom and fit-to-view controls
     - Ensure smooth interaction and proper cursor feedback

  **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
  - All three visualization tabs display meaningful, interactive graphs
  - Dependencies graph shows task relationships and subtask connections
  - Timeline graph displays chronological task progression
  - Status flow displays kanban-style workflow visualization
  - Subtask modals show comprehensive execution information
  - All graphs support pan and zoom interactions
  - Graph controls function properly for navigation

  **Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Maintain standalone HTML file approach (no external dependencies)
  - Ensure responsive design and mobile compatibility
  - Use vanilla JavaScript and SVG for visualizations
  - Preserve existing functionality and auto-loading capabilities
