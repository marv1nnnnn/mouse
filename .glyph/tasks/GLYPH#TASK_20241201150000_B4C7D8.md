TaskID: GLYPH#TASK_20241201150000_B4C7D8
Title: Build Standalone HTML Glyph Tasks Dashboard
Description: |
  Create a standalone HTML file to visualize Glyph Protocol task and plan files with interactive features.
  
  **Background/Context:** User requested a visualization tool for .glyph folders that can work both with direct file opening (upload interface) and HTTP server auto-detection.
  
  **Specific Inputs:**
    - Existing Glyph Protocol specification from core_protocol.glyph
    - Task file structure from task_structure_example.glyph.mdc
    - Plan file structure from plan_file_structure.glyph.mdc
    - Example task and plan files: GLYPH#TASK_20240721100000_A1B2C3.md and corresponding plan
  
  **Detailed Requirements/Steps:**
    1. Create a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript (no external dependencies)
    2. Implement dual-mode operation:
       - Direct file opening: Show upload interface for .glyph folder selection
       - HTTP server mode: Auto-detect and load .glyph folder from root directory
    3. Parse task files (.md with YAML frontmatter) and plan files (_plan.md with structured markdown)
    4. Create interactive visualizations:
       - Overview tab with task cards in a grid layout
       - Dependencies graph showing task and subtask relationships
       - Timeline view showing chronological task progression
       - Status flow view (kanban-style) grouping tasks by status
    5. Implement task detail modal with subtask information and execution logs
    6. Ensure responsive design and aesthetic appearance
    7. Handle drag-and-drop file upload functionality
    8. Parse and display task metadata, subtasks, execution logs, and relationships
  
  **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
    - Single HTML file `glyph_dashboard.html` that opens directly in browser
    - Successful parsing of YAML frontmatter from task files
    - Successful parsing of structured markdown from plan files
    - Interactive dashboard with multiple visualization modes
    - Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
    - Drag-and-drop functionality for .glyph folder upload
    - Auto-detection capability when served via HTTP server
    - Task detail modals showing comprehensive information including subtasks and logs
  
  **Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - Must be completely standalone (no external CDN dependencies)
    - Must work offline after initial load
    - Should handle dozens of tasks without performance issues
    - Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
    - Responsive design for mobile devices
    - Clean, professional aesthetic following modern UI/UX principles

## Implementation Notes:

The dashboard has been successfully implemented as a single HTML file with the following key features:

### Core Functionality:
- **Dual-mode operation**: Upload interface for direct file opening, auto-detection for HTTP server deployment
- **YAML frontmatter parsing**: Robust parsing of task file metadata including HistoryLog entries
- **Markdown parsing**: Structured parsing of plan files with subtask extraction and execution logs
- **Multiple visualization modes**: Overview grid, dependencies graph, timeline, and status flow views

### Interactive Features:
- **Task cards**: Clickable cards showing key task information with status-based color coding
- **Detail modals**: Comprehensive task details including subtasks, execution logs, and metadata
- **Responsive tabs**: Easy navigation between different visualization modes
- **Drag-and-drop**: Intuitive file upload with visual feedback

### Technical Implementation:
- **Zero dependencies**: All functionality implemented with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Mobile responsive**: CSS Grid and Flexbox layout with mobile-first responsive design
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient parsing and rendering for dozens of tasks
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of malformed files and edge cases

### Design Quality:
- **Modern aesthetic**: Clean, professional design with gradient backgrounds and subtle shadows
- **Accessibility**: Good contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader friendly
- **Status visualization**: Color-coded status indicators following common UI patterns
- **Loading states**: Clear feedback during file processing and data loading

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements and provides an extensible foundation for future enhancements.
