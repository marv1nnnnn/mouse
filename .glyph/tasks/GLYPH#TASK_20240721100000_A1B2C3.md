Title: Build a Minimum Movie Recommendation System
Description: |
  Develop a basic movie recommendation system using mock data.
  The system should be content-based, focusing on movie genres.

  **Background/Context:** User request to build a foundational recommendation system.
  **Specific Inputs:**
    - Mock movie data (title, genres, ID).
    - Mock user rating data (user ID, movie ID, rating - rating can be implicit, e.g., watched/not watched or explicit 1-5).
  **Detailed Requirements/Steps:**
    1. Define data structures for movies and user ratings.
    2. Create mock data for a small set of movies and users.
    3. Implement a recommendation algorithm:
       - Takes a user ID as input.
       - Identifies user's preferred genres based on their rated/watched movies.
       - Recommends other movies with matching genres that the user hasn't interacted with.
    4. Provide a simple command-line interface to get recommendations for a given user.
  **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
    - Python scripts containing the mock data, recommendation logic, and main interface.
    - The system successfully provides a list of recommended movies for a test user ID based on genre matching.
    - A `README.md` explaining how to run the system.
  **Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - Use standard Python libraries.
    - Keep the implementation simple and focused on the core recommendation logic.
