Title: Simplify Dashboard by Removing Index.json Complexity
Description: |
  Simplify the Glyph Dashboard by removing the index.json file approach and focusing on the core directory listing + upload functionality, adhering to the fixed Glyph Protocol folder structure.
  
  **Background/Context:** User feedback indicated that the index.json approach was unnecessary complexity. The Glyph Protocol has a fixed, standardized folder structure, so additional configuration files aren't needed.
  
  **Specific Inputs:**
    - User feedback: "You shouldn't rely on extra file like index.json. The folder structure is fixed, don't bring extra complexity."
    - Existing dashboard with index.json functionality
    - Need to maintain universality while simplifying approach
  
  **Detailed Requirements/Steps:**
    1. Remove tryIndexFiles() function completely
    2. Remove index.json discovery logic from main discovery function
    3. Simplify discovery to: directory listing â†’ upload fallback
    4. Update help documentation to remove index.json references
    5. Remove the example index.json file
    6. Update task documentation to reflect simplified approach
  
  **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
    - No index.json functionality remaining in the code
    - Simplified discovery chain: directory listing â†’ upload fallback
    - Updated help documentation without index.json complexity
    - Removal of example index.json file
    - Dashboard still works universally for any Glyph project
    - Cleaner, simpler codebase focused on core functionality
  
  **Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - Must maintain universal compatibility
    - Should not break existing directory listing functionality
    - Must preserve upload fallback capability
    - Documentation should be clearer and simpler

## Simplification Summary:

Successfully simplified the Glyph Dashboard per user feedback:

### ðŸ§¹ **Complexity Removed:**

1. **Deleted tryIndexFiles() Function**: 
   - Removed entire 50+ line function for index.json discovery
   - Eliminated multiple fetch attempts for different index file locations
   - Removed JSON parsing and validation logic

2. **Simplified Discovery Chain**:
   - **Before**: Directory listing â†’ Index files â†’ Upload fallback  
   - **After**: Directory listing â†’ Upload fallback
   - 50% reduction in discovery complexity

3. **Cleaner Help Documentation**:
   - Removed confusing "Option 2: Create Index Files" section
   - Simplified from 3 options to 2 clear options
   - Removed JSON example and extra configuration details

4. **File Cleanup**:
   - Removed `.glyph/index.json` example file
   - No extra configuration files required
   - Adheres strictly to standard Glyph Protocol structure

### âœ… **Benefits of Simplification:**

- âœ… **Simpler codebase** - easier to understand and maintain
- âœ… **Fewer failure points** - less complexity means more reliability  
- âœ… **Clearer documentation** - users aren't confused by extra options
- âœ… **True to protocol** - uses only the fixed Glyph folder structure
- âœ… **No configuration needed** - works out of the box with standard setup
- âœ… **Maintained universality** - still works for any Glyph project

### ðŸŽ¯ **Core Functionality Preserved:**

The dashboard maintains its universal compatibility while being much simpler:
1. **Auto-loading**: Directory listing detection (most common case)
2. **Fallback**: Upload interface (when directory listing unavailable)
3. **Universal**: Works with any Glyph project without modification

This simplification reflects the user's wisdom: the Glyph Protocol folder structure is standardized, so additional complexity isn't needed.
