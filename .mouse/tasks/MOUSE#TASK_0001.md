Title: "Build a Minimum Music Recommendation System in Python"
Description: |
  Create a simple music recommendation system in Python that can suggest music to users based on their preferences.
  
  - **Background/Context:** Need a basic system to demonstrate recommendation capabilities.
  - **Specific Inputs:**
    - User preferences data
    - Music metadata (genres, artists, etc.)
  - **Detailed Requirements:**
    1. Create data structures for music and user preferences
    2. Implement a basic recommendation algorithm
    3. Provide a simple interface for getting recommendations
    4. Document the usage and approach
  - **Desired Outputs & Verifiable Success Criteria:**
    - A functional Python module that can recommend music based on user preferences
    - Clear documentation on how to use the system
    - Simple example demonstrating the recommendation process
  - **Constraints:**
    - Keep the implementation simple and focused
    - Use standard Python libraries where possible

## Task Elaboration

This task involves building a minimum viable music recommendation system in Python. The system should:

1. **Handle Music Data:** Create data structures to represent music items with attributes like genre, artist, release year, etc.

2. **Model User Preferences:** Store and model user preferences such as favorite genres, artists, or songs.

3. **Recommendation Algorithm:** Implement a simple recommendation algorithm that matches user preferences with music attributes.

4. **Interface:** Provide a clean, simple interface for:
   - Adding music to the catalog
   - Recording user preferences
   - Generating recommendations for a user

The implementation should focus on core functionality rather than scaling or advanced features. It should serve as a proof of concept that demonstrates the basic principles of a recommendation system.
