## Task Elaboration

The main goal is to improve the visual consistency and readability of the `mouse_dashboard.html` page when the system or browser is in dark mode. Key areas to investigate and fix are:

1.  **Log Filters:** Ensure text color, background color, and border colors are appropriate for dark mode.
2.  **Final Output of Subtasks:** Check how preformatted text or code blocks within the final output summary are displayed; ensure they have dark-friendly styling.
3.  **Execution Order Display:** Verify that any visual indicators or text related to execution order are clearly visible and styled for dark mode.

The fixes will likely involve adding or modifying CSS rules, possibly targeting `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media queries or classes applied when dark mode is active.
