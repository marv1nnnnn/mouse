## Task Elaboration

This task focuses on improving the visual design and user experience of the Mouse Dashboard interface. The current styling has a somewhat generic appearance that feels template-driven. The goal is to transform it into a more professional, visually appealing interface with modern design elements and a dark mode option.

Key improvements will include:

1. **Modern Visual Design:**
   - Refine color palette for better contrast and visual hierarchy
   - Improve typography choices and spacing
   - Update card and container styling with more subtle shadows and refined borders
   - Enhance data visualization components

2. **Dark Mode Implementation:**
   - Add a persistent dark/light mode toggle
   - Create a comprehensive dark theme color palette
   - Ensure all components have appropriate dark mode styling
   - Save user preference in local storage

3. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Improve responsive behavior across different screen sizes
   - Refine interactive elements (buttons, tabs, filters)
   - Add subtle transitions and hover states
   - Enhance visual feedback for actions

4. **Code Quality:**
   - Organize CSS for better maintainability
   - Use CSS variables for consistent theming
   - Ensure all styling works across modern browsers
   - Add appropriate comments for future maintenance

The updated dashboard should maintain all existing functionality while providing a significantly improved visual experience that feels professional and polished.
