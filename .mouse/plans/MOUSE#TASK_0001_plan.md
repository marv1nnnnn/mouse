## Overall Plan Notes & Strategy

This plan follows a modular approach to building a minimum viable music recommendation system:

1. **Data Structure Design**: First, we'll define the core data structures needed to represent music items and user preferences. This will be the foundation for the system.

2. **Recommendation Algorithms**: Next, we'll implement simple recommendation algorithms based on similarity between user preferences and music attributes.

3. **Sample Data and Examples**: We'll create sample data and example code to demonstrate the system in action.

4. **Documentation**: Finally, we'll ensure the code is properly documented and create a README with clear usage instructions.

The implementation will prioritize simplicity and readability over performance or advanced features. We'll use standard Python libraries and avoid external dependencies where possible to keep the system minimalistic.
