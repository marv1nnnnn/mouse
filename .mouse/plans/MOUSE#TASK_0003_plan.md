## Overall Plan Notes & Strategy

The approach will be to tackle each UI component mentioned in the user's request as a separate sub-task. This involves:
1.  Inspecting the relevant HTML elements and their current CSS in dark mode.
2.  Identifying the specific CSS rules that need adjustment (e.g., text color, background color, border color).
3.  Implementing the fixes, likely within existing dark mode CSS blocks or by adding new ones.
4.  Verifying the fix for that specific component.

After individual components are addressed, a final sub-task will cover a holistic review to ensure all changes work well together and the overall dark mode experience is polished.

Added SUB.08 and SUB.09 to address specific rework item for #f0f8ff background from user feedback.
User has also manually updated --color-primary, --color-secondary, --color-tertiary for dark mode in mouse_dashboard.html; these changes will be respected.

We will be modifying `mouse_dashboard.html`.
